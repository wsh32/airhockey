# FlexyStepper - Arduino Library

This library is used to control one or more stepper motors.  The motors are accelerated and decelerated as they travel to their destination.  The library has been optimized for flexible control where speeds and positions can be changed while in-motion.

Note: FlexyStepper's companion library that supports faster step rates can be found here:
